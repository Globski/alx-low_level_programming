# Low-Level Programming - C Makefiles

## Project Description:
This project focuses on understanding Makefiles in C programming. It covers creating Makefiles to automate the compilation process, managing dependencies, and utilizing various rules and variables.

## Project Structure:
| Task                     | Description                                              | Source Code                                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-Makefile               | Create your first Makefile.                              | [0-Makefile](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/0-Makefile)               |
| 1-Makefile               | Create a Makefile with variables.                        | [1-Makefile](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/1-Makefile)               |
| 2-Makefile               | Create a useful Makefile with dependencies.              | [2-Makefile](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/2-Makefile)               |
| 3-Makefile               | Create a Makefile with additional rules and cleaning.     | [3-Makefile](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/3-Makefile)               |
| 4-Makefile               | Implement a complete Makefile with compiler flags.       | [4-Makefile](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/4-Makefile)               |
| 5-island_perimeter.py    | Implement a function to calculate island perimeter.       | [5-island_perimeter.py](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/5-island_perimeter.py) |
| 100-Makefile             | Advanced Makefile implementation with specific rules.    | [100-Makefile](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles/blob/main/100-Makefile)           |

## Environment:
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Version of gcc:** 9.3.0
- **Version of make:** GNU Make 4.2.1

## Learning Objectives:
By completing this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in:
- Understanding make and Makefiles
- Utilizing rules, variables, and dependencies
- Implementing explicit and implicit rules
- Handling cleaning and recompilation processes
- Working with compiler flags

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository from [alx-low_level_programming](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming).
2. Navigate to the directory `0x1C-makefiles`.
3. Choose the Makefile you want to run and execute the `make` command with the appropriate file name.
   Example: `make -f 0-Makefile`
