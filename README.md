# C Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects covering various topics. Each project is designed to help you learn and practice different aspects of C programming.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world) | Basic "Hello, World!" programs in C to introduce you to the language and the compilation process. |
| [0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | Work with variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while) to build foundational C programming skills. |
| [0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) | Explore the concept of functions and nested loops to create more complex programs. |
| [0x03-debugging](./0x03-debugging) | Learn about debugging techniques and how to fix common programming errors in C. |
| [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | Continue working with functions and nested loops, diving deeper into C programming concepts. |
| [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | Delve into pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in C, fundamental for many applications. |
| [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) | Build on your knowledge of pointers, arrays, and strings to tackle more advanced programming challenges. |
| [0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) | Further explore pointers, arrays, and strings to enhance your C programming skills. |
| [0x08-recursion](./0x08-recursion) | Learn about recursion and how to use it in C to solve complex problems. |
| [0x09-static_libraries](./0x09-static_libraries) | Understand the concept of static libraries and how to create and use them in your C programs. |
| [0x0A-argc_argv](./0x0A-argc_argv) | Work with command-line arguments and understand how to pass arguments to C programs. |
| [0x0B-malloc_free](./0x0B-malloc_free) | Explore dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free` in C. |
| [0x0C-more_malloc_free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free) | Build on your knowledge of dynamic memory allocation with advanced memory management techniques. |
| [0x0D-preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor) | Learn about the C preprocessor and how to use preprocessor directives to modify your code. |
| [0x0E-structures_typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef) | Discover how to work with structures and typedef to create custom data types in C. |
| [0x0F-function_pointers](./0x0F-function_pointers) | Understand the concept of function pointers and how to use them to create flexible programs. |
| [0x10-variadic_functions](./0x10-variadic_functions) | Dive into variadic functions and learn how to work with functions that accept a variable number of arguments. |
| [0x11-printf](https://github.com/Globski/printf) |  Implement a custom printf function in C that replicates the behavior of the standard library printf. This project focuses on handling various format specifiers, advanced features, and optimizing buffer usage for efficient printing. |
