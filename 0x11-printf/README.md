## Introduction

Welcome to the Printf Project, where we implement a custom `printf` function in C. The project follows the rules and guidelines set forth by Holberton School and focuses on recreating the behavior of the standard C library `printf` function.

## Objectives

- Implement a custom `printf` function in C.
- Handle various format specifiers and custom conversions.
- Optimize buffer usage for efficient printing.
  
## Project Overview

This project includes the following tasks:

| Project | Description | Source Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Task 0** | Write a function that produces output according to a format. | [Task 0 Source](task_0.c) |
| **Task 1** | Handle the conversion specifiers `%d` and `%i`. | [Task 1 Source](task_1.c) |
| **Task 2** | Implement the custom conversion specifier `%b` for binary. | [Task 2 Source](task_2.c) |
| **Task 3** | Handle conversion specifiers `%u`, `%o`, `%x`, and `%X`. | [Task 3 Source](task_3.c) |
| **Task 4** | Optimize buffer usage. | [Task 4 Source](task_4.c) |
| **Task 5** | Add the custom specifier `%S` for non-printable characters. | [Task 5 Source](task_5.c) |
| **Task 6** | Handle the conversion specifier `%p`. | [Task 6 Source](task_6.c) |
| **Task 7** | Handle flag characters: `+`, space, `#`. | [Task 7 Source](task_7.c) |
| **Task 8** | Handle length modifiers: `l` and `h`. | [Task 8 Source](task_8.c) |
| **Task 9** | Handle field width. | [Task 9 Source](task_9.c) |
| **Task 10** | Handle precision. | [Task 10 Source](task_10.c) |
| **Task 11** | Handle the 0 flag character. | [Task 11 Source](task_11.c) |
| **Task 12** | Handle the - flag character. | [Task 12 Source](task_12.c) |
| **Task 13** | Implement the custom specifier `%r` for reversed strings. | [Task 13 Source](task_13.c) |
| **Task 14** | Add the custom specifier `%R` for ROT13. | [Task 14 Source](task_14.c) |
| **Task 15** | All the above options work well together. | [Task 15 Source](task_15.c) |

## Getting Started

To use our custom `printf` function, you can clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/printf.git
```

After cloning, you can compile and link your code with our printf function using the provided Makefile.

## Usage
To use the printf function, include the holberton.h header and call _printf with your desired format string and arguments. Here's a basic example:

```c
#include "holberton.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "World");
    return (0);
}
```

## Format Specifiers
Our custom printf function supports the following format specifiers:

- %c: Character
- %s: String
- %%: Percent
- %d and %i: Decimal and Integer
- %b: Binary (Custom)
- %u: Unsigned Integer
- %o: Octal
- %x and %X: Hexadecimal

## Advanced Features
Our custom printf function includes several advanced features:

- Handling flag characters: +, space, and #
- Handling length modifiers: l and h
- Handling field width
- Handling precision
- Handling flag character 0
- Handling flag character -
- Custom specifier for non-printable characters %S
- Custom specifier for reversed string %r
- Custom specifier for ROT13 %R
