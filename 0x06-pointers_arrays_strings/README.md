# Low-Level Programming -  Pointers, arrays and strings

| project      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  [0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c)  | A function that concatenates two strings. Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src); This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte. Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest|
|  [1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c)  |A function that concatenates two strings. Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n); The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes. Return a pointer to the resulting string dest |
|  [2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c)  | A function that copies a string. Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n); Your function should work exactly like strncpy|
|  [3-strcmp.c](./3-strcmp.c)  | A function that compares two strings. Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2); Your function should work exactly like strcmp|
|  [4-rev_array.c](./4-rev_array.c)  | A function that reverses the content of an array of integers. Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n); Where n is the number of elements of the array |
|  [5-string_toupper.c](./5-string_toupper.c)  | A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase. Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);|
|  [6-cap_string.c](./6-cap_string.c)  | A function that capitalizes all words of a string. Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);|
|  [7-leet.c](./7-leet.c)  | A function that encodes a string into 1337. Letters a and A should be replaced by 4. Letters e and E should be replaced by 3. Letters o and O should be replaced by 0. Letters t and T should be replaced by 7. Letters l and L should be replaced by 1. Prototype: char *leet(char *);|
|  [100-rot13.c](./100-rot13.c)  |A function that encodes a string using rot13. Prototype: char *rot13(char *); |
|  [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c)  | A function that prints an integer. Prototype: void print_number(int n);|
|  [102-magic.c](./102-magic.c)  | Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.|
|  [103-infinite_add.c](./103-infinite_add.c)  |  A function that adds two numbers. Prototype: char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r); Where n1 and n2 are the two numbers r is the buffer that the function will use to store the result size_r is the buffer size. The function returns a pointer to the result. You can assume that you will always get positive numbers, or 0. You can assume that there will be only digits in the strings n1 and n2, n1 and n2 will never be empty. If the result can not be stored in r the function must return 0|
|  [104-print_buffer.c](./104-print_buffer.c)  |a function that prints a buffer. Prototype: void print_buffer(char *b, int size); The function must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b. The output should print 10 bytes per line. Each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0. Each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space. Each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print . Each line ends with a new line \n. If size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n. You are allowed to use the standard library|
